# Consilium

Consilium is a calender style personal planner that I designed for a client as part of VCE Software Development. 
This was my first large endevour into programming and UI design. The project was created mainly with Javascript and CSS, as well as libraries such as MDL and the Electron framework. Please note that the code in this program is quite poor as I was very much a novice at the time I made it. I've decided to leave this up as despite the shortcomings, Im still proud of what I managed to achive at the time. If you're curious, here is a video I made of the application functioning during development. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Crohd9rd2SE
